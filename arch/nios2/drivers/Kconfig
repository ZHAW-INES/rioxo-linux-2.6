	  This driver provides support for automatic reconfiguration of a
	  CycloneIII FPGA (Possibly others too).

	  The ALTREMOTE_UPDATE megafunction requires that you only provide it
	  the 22 highest-order bits of a 24-bit address offset.

	  This options controls the value by which the address offset of the
	  FPGA configuration image is shifted depending on the data width of
	  the flash where your image is stored.

	  EPCS flash data witdh is usually 8 bit
	  CFI flash data width is usually 16 bit

config ALTERA_REMOTE_UPDATE_FLASH_WIDTH_8
	bool "8 bits (shift address by 2)"
config ALTERA_REMOTE_UPDATE_FLASH_WIDTH_16
	bool "16 bits (shift address by 3)"

	depends on (ALTERA_STRATIX || ALTERA_STRATIX_PRO || ALTERA_CYCLONE)
	help
	  This enables example code to support leds, and seven segment
	  display as PIO devices. Once enabled, the kernel will show a
	  counter (increas once a second) on these devices.
